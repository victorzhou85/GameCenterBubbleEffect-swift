Here is the GIF preview of this project : https://www.dropbox.com/s/hutbg19f50ds68i/game.gif?dl=0
(somehow, I fail to add the gif directly to the readme file ... sad)

Code:
The code is quite simple. The whole principle is add three CAAnimation to single view, including moving around, squeez in x direction and y direction. 

Usage:
Just Drag the bubbleView.swift to your project folder and create a UIView subclass in your desire viewcontroller or just Drag a new UIView in storyboard and set it to be the subclass of bubbleView.
